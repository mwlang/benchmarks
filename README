This project contains a collection of projects and findings from my various benchmarking activities.

I discuss my findings herein at http://ramblings.gibberishcode.net and the aim of this repository
is to provide the code and detail datasets to all that wish to review further and perhaps
attempt to replicate my findings.

Any questions, please feel free to reach out to me.

Regards,

Michael
